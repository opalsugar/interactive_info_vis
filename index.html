              <strong>Context</strong></p>
              <p>
              This prototype allows users to plan
              their morning at the start of the day or the night before,
              starting at 6am and going till 10am. The point of this prototype
              is to allow users to understand how long their morning routine
              tasks actually take them, and dynamically show them when they'll
              be done with their tasks based on how long it actually takes them
              to complete each task.
            </p>
            <strong>Design Decisions</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Tabular Format:</strong> This clock follows a
                    tabular format where each task fills up slowly over time.
                    This is similar to a google calendar setup that time
                    blockers commonly use, making it intuitive to what users may
                    already be used to and allows the actual and intended plan
                    to be easy to read. One constraint is that the timer does
                    not automatically check actual time and is limited to 6 to
                    10am.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Pastel Colors:</strong> For each task, colors are
                    randomly generated using RGB values but will always be light
                    or pastel colored. This guarantees that the text inside each
                    task will always be readable regardless of the randomly
                    generated task color.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Interaction:</strong> Rather than using a task
                    dictionary, this prototype allows users to add their own
                    task names and task times to the calendar, making it fully
                    customizable to their morning routine.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Future Work</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Setting Time Frame:</strong> Making it so the user
                    can decide on the total time interval. For example, they
                    could select 5 hours and the clock auto adjusts to be from
                    6am to 11am.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Tracking Actual Time:</strong> A good future change
                    could be making it so the user inputs a total time frame and
                    then when they click "Start", it auto-adjusts to the
                    starting time and time frame. For example, a user can select
                    5 hours and start the timer at 8am, and the clock adjusts to
                    be from 8am to 1pm.
                  </li>
                </ul>

              <strong>Context</strong></p>
              <p>
                This prototype is focused on creating some space in a person's morning routine to
                focus on mindfulness by combining it with their morning coffee. It includes a
                calming 5-minute meditation focused on morning coffee sourced from YouTube,
                where the user focuses on their breathing and sipping their drink to get some
                relaxation in even during busy mornings.
            </p>
            <strong>Design Decisions</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Coffee Cup Design:</strong> To add to the aesthetic of
                    morning meditation, I decided to use the visual of a coffee cup
                    emptying as the timer. This is to subtly encourage the user to take
                    sips of their drink as they participate in the meditation, allowing
                    them to feel present with both the meditation and with their cup.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Meditation Audio:</strong> Initially I was just planning to
                    make this a timer, but based on feedback from my roommate I decided
                    to find a coffee meditation online and embed it into the timer. This
                    creates a relaxing atmosphere with a guided audio telling the user
                    how to breathe, what to focus on and when to sip their drink,
                    enhancing the immersion and relaxation gained from the experience.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Start, Pause and Reset Buttons:</strong> Rather than just making
                    it a simple timer that counts down, I wanted the user to not feel obstructed
                    when using the timer, giving them the option to pause if something comes up,
                    restart if they feel interrupted, or end the meditation early.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Future Work</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Different Coffee Drinks:</strong> Adding different types of
                    drinks would allow the user to customize their experience based on
                    their favorite drink in the morning, enhancing the visual appeal and
                    aesthetic experience. This was suggested from class feedback.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Different Meditations and Times:</strong> An addition to the first
                    idea could also be having different meditation audios and timers for
                    different drinks, some being longer and shorter and maybe themed
                    around the drink, both enhancing customizability and appeal.

              <strong>Context</strong></p>
              <p>
                This prototype is focused on encouraging users to take shorter showers,
                both to increase the amount of time they have in the mornings and also
                to be sustainable with their water usage. When the timer ends, an alarm
                goes off, but the timer continues and the tub overflows to show excess
                water usage and to track how long the user's shower lasts.
            </p>
            <strong>Design Decisions</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Time Selection:</strong>For this timer, I wanted a constraint
                    of 5 minutes without customizability as the whole point was to encourage
                    shorter showers to save time, water and energy. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Sustainable Colors:</strong>I decided to make all text blue to
                    complement the aesthetic of sustainability and saving water, with the timer
                    turning red if it goes into the negatives to indicate overuse of water.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Visual and Auditory Design:</strong> Initially, the only planned
                    feedback for going over time would be to have the water in the tub start
                    to overflow. However, I got some feedback from the class that it would be
                    difficult for a person to know they went over if they were in the shower,
                    so I also added auditory feedback where an alarm goes off when 5 minutes are up
                    and the timer is going into the negatives.
                </ul>
                <strong>Future Work</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Daily Shower Tracking:</strong> An interesting addition could be
                    a calendar where users have a way to track how long their showers are everyday
                    and how much water they're using or saving. It could be a good way to incentivize
                    consistently taking shorter showers.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Multiple Alarms:</strong> Currently, there is only one alarm when the timer goes
                    past 5 minutes. It could be interesting to have multiple timers, like one after 3 more minutes,
                    then after 2, and then after 1 and so on. This could help create a sense of urgency for
                    the user and make them speed up to reduce the length of their shower.
